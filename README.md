# Frontlett Chatbot

A customer service chatbot powered by FastAPI and integrated with a knowledge base of frequently asked questions (FAQ) stored in Supabase. This chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) and the LangChain framework to provide intelligent, real-time responses based on the provided FAQs.

## Features

- **FAQ-based chatbot**: The chatbot is trained on a set of FAQs, allowing it to respond intelligently to queries about Frontlett's services, especially their Virtualting model and other core offerings.
- **Real-time answers**: The chatbot uses a knowledge base from Supabase to search and match relevant FAQs for a quick response.
- **Business model summarization**: The chatbot can summarize and provide information about Frontlett's business model using the FAQ content.
- **Web integration**: The chatbot is deployed as a web service and can be accessed via an API or a web interface.
- **Scalability**: Built for scale, the chatbot is designed to handle multiple users with minimal resources.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)
- **Supabase account** (to store FAQ data)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontlett-chatbot.git
cd frontlett-chatbot
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with your environment variables. Here is an example of what the `.env` file should look like:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

### Populate the FAQ Database

You can use the `scripts/populate_faqs.py` script to populate the FAQ data in your Supabase database. Before running it, make sure you have the required environment variables configured in your `.env` file.

```bash
python scripts/populate_faqs.py
```

### Run the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.routes:fastapi_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

You should now be able to access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Testing the API

You can use `curl` or Postman to test the `/chat` endpoint. Here's an example `curl` command to test it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "What is Virtualting?"}'
```

### Access the Swagger UI

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive Swagger UI at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

This interface allows you to interact with the API and test various endpoints.

## Deployment

### Deploy on Render

1. Go to [Render](https://render.com).
2. Create a new **Web Service**.
3. Connect it to your GitHub repository and configure it with the appropriate environment variables.
4. Set the **Start Command** to:

```bash
uvicorn app.routes:fastapi_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
```

### Alternative: Deploy using Docker

If you'd like to deploy the application using Docker, you can create a Docker image with the following steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t frontlett-chatbot .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 frontlett-chatbot
   ```

This will start the app in a container and expose it on port 8000.
