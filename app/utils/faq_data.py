        "question": "What is Virtualting?",
        "answer": "Virtualting is Frontlett's collaborative-based staff-sharing model, designed with a value-driven approach. The word 'Virtualting' is a portmanteau of 'virtual' and 'ting' - essentially a new term introduced to describe this work model. It was developed as an innovative concept by ASIN5 Lab (a startup studio and service incubator in Abuja, Nigeria) and has been adopted by Frontlett. In practice, Virtualting is a model of work that allows talented individuals to work for more than one company at the same time (up to a maximum of four companies), with those companies splitting the employee's salary either equally or based on hours worked. This approach helps businesses fill non-critical roles and complete their teams while staying within budget."

        "question": "How is Virtualting different from freelancing?",
        "answer": "Virtualting is different from freelancing in a couple of key ways. First, Frontlett (through the Virtualting platform) actively manages the relationship between the employee and the employer (providing oversight and support to both). Second, Virtualting engagements involve defined employment contracts with each participating employer on a full-time basis (FTE), rather than the short-term or ad-hoc arrangements typical in freelancing. In short, a Virtualting worker is more like a shared full-time employee across several companies, rather than an independent freelancer."

    {
        "question": "Is Virtualting a remote working or in-office working model?",
        "answer": "Virtualting is primarily a remote working model, but it can also accommodate in-office work depending on the agreement with the employer. In cases where an employer requires in-office presence, the employer must take up at least 2 slots (which equals 4 hours per day) of the talent's time. This ensures that if a Virtualting arrangement includes on-site work, the employee dedicates a significant and structured portion of their day to that company (rather than sporadic office hours)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a 'slot'?",
        "answer": "In the context of Frontlett's Virtualting model, a 'slot' is a 2-hour block of work time. The standard full workday is 8 hours, and the Virtualting model divides this into four slots. This means a talent can work for up to four different companies in one day, dedicating about 2 hours (one slot) to each company (if they utilize all four slots). Each slot represents one part of the day assigned to one employer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do I have to be available to work on a company's task at a particular time or can it be on my own time?",
        "answer": "You cannot work at any random time you choose; instead, you must agree on a specific schedule with each employer. In a Virtualting arrangement, the talent and the employer decide on a set time slot each day during which the talent will work on that company's tasks, and the talent is expected to stick to that schedule. Essentially, you are a fully integrated team member of each company during your allotted time, not a freelancer working on a purely ad-hoc schedule, so you need to be available at the agreed-upon times."
    },
    {
        "question": "How do I get started with Frontlett?",
        "answer": "To get started, you need to sign up as a talent on Frontlett's platform and submit your profile for review. This can be done through the Frontlett signup portal or by emailing your details to info@frontlett.com. Once your profile is submitted, Frontlett will proceed with their onboarding process. Essentially, the first step is creating an account and providing your professional information."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do I have to deposit one month's salary on the platform?",
        "answer": "Frontlett requires a deposit equal to one month's salary as a form of security or commitment. This deposit serves as a safeguard in case you (the employee) resign without giving the required 4-6 weeks' notice as stipulated in your contract. In other words, it discourages sudden departures; if a talent leaves prematurely without proper notice, the deposit can help cover the interim period or any related costs as per the agreement. This policy ensures reliability and commitment from talents participating in the Virtualting program."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are 'Virtualtlancer' jobs?",
        "answer": "Virtualtlancer jobs are a different category of work on Frontlett's platform. These are essentially one-off tasks or gigs posted by employers, rather than ongoing roles. In cases where an employer has a task or project that is short-term or does not justify hiring a permanent or long-term employee, they can post it as a Virtualtlancer job on the platform. Skilled individuals (talents on Frontlett) can then take on these tasks. In summary, Virtualtlancer jobs are ad-hoc tasks that employers need done on a temporary basis, which are made available for Frontlett talents to handle."
